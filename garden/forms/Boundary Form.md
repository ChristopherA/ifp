# Boundary Form

**Core question**: "Where does this system's authority end?"

A declaration of what an agent (LLM, individual, group) may and may not decide. Not *what* the right choice is (principle), not *how* to make it (protocol), but *who holds authority*. Boundaries are the governance layer — the rules about who gets to play and what moves they can make. Amendable through deliberative process, never unilaterally by an LLM.

## Structural Contract

A boundary form requires:

- **Authority zones** — A table or structured list showing zones of authority with levels (autonomous, guided, escalate, prohibited) and examples for each zone.
- **Agent behavior at boundaries** — Steps for recognition and escalation when an agent encounters the boundary edge.
- **Amendment** — How the boundary can be changed and by whom. This section is mandatory because boundaries without amendment processes become brittle.
- **Sources** — Values and principles the boundary is grounded in.
- **Relations** — Connections to principles it enforces, models it constrains, and patterns it governs.

Naming heuristic: what's bounded + distinctive feature. "Delegated Decision Authority Spectrum" not "Authority Boundary."

## Typical Predicates

- `is_a::[[Boundary Form]]`
- `has_status::[[Seed Stage]]` or `[[Growing Stage]]`
- `in_domain::[[Deep Context Architecture]]`
- `grounded_in::[[Value]]` — values that justify the boundary
- `embodies::[[Pattern Form]]` — patterns that demonstrate the boundary
- `relates_to::[[Principle Form]]`, `[[Model Form]]`

## Exemplars

- [[Delegated Decision Authority Spectrum]] — authority zone table with HAAH spectrum, amendment process, and escalation steps

## Category

Governance form — establishes *who decides* and *how rules change*.
