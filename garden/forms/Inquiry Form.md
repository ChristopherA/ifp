# Inquiry Form

**Core question**: "What should we think about X, and how would we find out?"

A thesis-driven investigation that marshals existing evidence, proposes hypotheses, and directs specific questions at specific people or groups. Distinguished from a gloss (which interprets existing sources) by being forward-looking rather than retrospective.

Inquiries are the primary generative form: their hypotheses, if tested, produce cases; their parallels, if validated, become patterns; their syntheses, if completed, become references. An inquiry may be resolved (producing other nodes) or persist as an open research thread.

## Structural Contract

An inquiry form requires:

- **Research question** — Clear framing of what's being investigated.
- **Current state** — What's known, what hypotheses exist, what evidence has been gathered.
- **Open questions** — Specific, answerable questions. Not vague wonderings.
- **Sources** — Evidence and references marshaled so far.
- **Relations** — Connections to nodes the inquiry draws on or may produce.

Optional: **Directed questions** using the `directed_at::` predicate to mark questions requiring a specific person's judgment. These are boundary markers — places where the system recognizes it has reached the limit of what it can resolve without human input.

Naming heuristic: scope of investigation + what's being determined.

## Typical Predicates

- `is_a::[[Inquiry Form]]`
- `has_status::[[Seed Stage]]` or `[[Growing Stage]]`
- `in_domain::[[Deep Context Architecture]]`
- `directed_at::[[Person Name]]` — flags questions for specific people
- `extracted_from::[[Research Note]]` — provenance
- `extends::[[Related Form]]` — applies a concept to new domain
- `relates_to::[[Gloss Form]]`, `[[Pattern Form]]`

## Exemplars

- [[Compound Node Meeting Structure]] — directed questions about meeting compound node design
- [[Personal Knowledge Management Method Adoption for Vault Architecture]] — comparative inquiry across personal knowledge management methods
- [[Vault-Wide Compound Node Adoption]] — investigation with resolved structure and remaining questions

## Category

## Relations

- relates_to::[[Gloss Form]] — inquiries that resolve interpretive questions produce glosses
- relates_to::[[Pattern Form]] — inquiries that identify recurring dynamics may crystallize into patterns
- relates_to::[[Decision Form]] — inquiries that require a choice produce decisions
- relates_to::[[Model Form]] — inquiries that map relationships produce models
